# Dispatch Telemetry

`harnex run` captures predicted-vs-actual dispatch telemetry for a wrapped
agent session. Raw measurements are emitted on the v1 events stream, and a
consolidated JSONL summary is appended for downstream analysis.

Every completed run also appends one compact dispatch-history record. In a git
repo, `harnex history` reads `<repo>/.harnex/dispatch.jsonl`; outside a git repo
it reads `~/.local/state/harnex/dispatch.jsonl`.

## CLI flags

```text
harnex run codex --meta '{"model":"gpt-5.3-codex","effort":"high","predicted":{"input_tokens":[200000,800000]}}'
harnex run codex --summary-out tmp/dispatch-summary.jsonl
```

- `--meta JSON` must be a JSON object. The parsed object is echoed verbatim on
  the `started.meta` event.
- `--summary-out PATH` writes the consolidated summary JSON line to `PATH`.
- If `--summary-out` is omitted and harnex has a non-empty resolved repo root,
  the summary path defaults to `<repo>/.harnex/dispatch.jsonl`, regardless of
  whether the repo has a legacy `koder/` directory.
- The compact history record is appended after the consolidated summary record.
  In the common git-repo default, both records are written to
  `<repo>/.harnex/dispatch.jsonl`; the compact record is the record intended for
  `harnex history`.

Use `harnex history --json | jq .` for pipelines over the repo-local log.

## Metadata and prediction contract

The consolidated record has `meta`, `predicted`, and `actual` blocks.

Harnex-owned `meta` fields are always populated when derivable: `id`,
`tmux_session`, `description`, `started_at`, `ended_at`, `harness`,
`harness_version`, `agent`, `agent_version`, `agent_provider`, `host`,
`platform`, `repo`, `branch`, `start_sha`, and `end_sha`.

These top-level `--meta` keys pass through into `meta` when provided:
`orchestrator`, `orchestrator_session`, `chain_id`, `parent_dispatch_id`,
`tier`, `phase`, `issue`, `plan`, and `task_brief`. Unknown top-level keys are
kept on `started.meta` but are not copied into the consolidated record.

`predicted` is copied verbatim from `--meta.predicted` when it is a JSON object;
otherwise it is `{}`. Harnex does no profile lookup or recommendation-table
resolution.

## Actuals

At process exit, harnex collects usage through the active adapter. JSON-RPC
Codex sessions read cumulative `thread/tokenUsage/updated` data; PTY adapters
parse the last 16 KB of transcript when they support a parser. Adapters without
a parser emit nullable usage fields.

Git actuals are captured with `git rev-parse`, `git diff --shortstat`, and
`git rev-list --count` between the start and end SHAs. Git failures leave the
corresponding consolidated fields `null` and omit `git` events.

The `actual` block includes model/effort hints from `--meta`, duration, token
counts, `agent_session_id`, adapter transport, git deltas, exit reason, task
completion state, signal/exit code, last error, operational counters
(`stalls`, `force_resumes`, `disconnections`, `compactions`, `turn_count`,
`tool_calls`, `commands_executed`), rate-limit payloads, output/event volume
measurements, and output/events log paths.

Cost and test-result fields are intentionally absent. Consumers compute cost
from their own pricing tables and test outcomes from their own CI or task
protocol.

## Exit taxonomy

- `success`: wrapped process exited `0` and a session summary was parsed.
- `failure`: wrapped process exited non-zero.
- `timeout`: wrapped process exited with code `124`.
- `boot_failure`: JSON-RPC app-server exited within the startup window before a
  turn was observed.
- `disconnected`: wrapped process exited `0` but no session summary was parsed.

Summary file writes are best-effort. Write failures are printed as warnings and
do not change the wrapped process exit code.
