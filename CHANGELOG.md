# Changelog

## [0.6.1] — 2026-05-06

### Added

- `harnex agents-guide [topic]` exposes dispatch, chain, buddy,
  monitoring, and naming guidance from the installed CLI.
- `harnex --help` now points agents to `harnex agents-guide`.
- `harnex help <command>` entries now include common patterns and gotchas for
  agent dispatch workflows.

### Removed

- `harnex skills install` and `harnex skills uninstall`.
- Bundled `skills/` sources and repo-local skill symlinks. Agents now discover
  guidance through `harnex --help` and `harnex agents-guide`.

### Notes

- `--legacy-pty` removal is still scheduled for 0.7.0.
- `man harnex` was deferred; the CLI-native `agents-guide` path satisfies the
  agent-discovery acceptance test without adding a man-page build dependency.

## 0.6.0 — 2026-05-06

### Architectural pivot: Codex on JSON-RPC

harnex now speaks `codex app-server` JSON-RPC over stdio for the
Codex adapter. Pane-scraping is retired for Codex. Closed by
construction:

- #22 (Codex side; `--watch --stall-after` still applies to
  claude/generic)
- #24 (disconnect detection — `error` notifications and JSON-RPC
  error responses replace screen-text regex)
- #25 (first-class completion signal — `turn/completed` is it)

### New

- `harnex wait --until task_complete` — block until a turn completes.
  Example: `harnex wait --id cx-i-242 --until task_complete`.
  Adapter-agnostic; tails the events JSONL.
- `harnex status --json` includes `last_completed_at`, `model`,
  `effort`, `auto_disconnects`.
- `harnex doctor` preflight checks Codex CLI ≥ 0.128.0.
- `Adapter#transport` and `Adapter#describe` extension points so
  callers can introspect adapter contracts. Default is
  `:pty` for backward compatibility.

### Migration

- Codex CLI ≥ 0.128.0 required.
- Existing `harnex run codex ...` invocations work unchanged.
- Emergency fallback: `harnex run codex --legacy-pty ...` (the
  pre-0.6.0 PTY adapter). Deprecated; will be removed in 0.7.0.

### Cross-repo

- Resolves holm #201 from the harnex side. holm #271 (substrate v2
  meta) tracks the broader pivot.
